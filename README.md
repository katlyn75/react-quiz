## Rules

1. **Make an initial commit when you start your work**
1. You have **25 minutes** to complete what you can.
1. You must complete this work on your own within the allotted time
    * You **need to manage your time** to have PR and last commit before deadline (remember, you can
    open PR and push your commits frequently).
1. You may use normal resources that a software developer uses on the job (docs, google, your prior work)
1. Working webpack react build system is included (**remember to `npm i` after cloning your forked repo!**)
1. You may install npm packages of your choosing, though probably not needed
1. Use general best practices and common sense
    * Highly recommended to implement what is needed, no more no less
    * Blind boilerplate or copying in code will not be helpful and will likely create more work
    * **Focus effort on requirements of the lab**
1. Total possible points are 50. You will be graded out of 40 points

## Submission requirement

* **Do a fork and PR like a normal lab**
* **There are no testing requirements**

## Base Requirements

Build an app that displays a list of notes. Use the following component structure:

* `App` - top level App component. **Notice that the component already has state of array of notes**
  * `Notes` - component that accepts an array of notes to display and creates a list with a `Note` component for each note
    * `Note` - component that accepts a note and displays the date and 
    text of the note.
  * **Bonus, Not Required** `AddNote` - form for adding a new note (add date with `new Date()`. Callback function gets passed from `App` to `AddNote` and updates `notes` in `App`
